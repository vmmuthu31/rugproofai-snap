# üéØ Immediate Production Fixes for RugProof Snap

## ‚úÖ **DONE - Critical Security Fix**

- [x] Created secure API configuration system
- [x] Removed hardcoded API keys from main code
- [x] Added API key validation

## üö® **URGENT - Next Steps (Do These First)**

### 1. **API Key Security** (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

The API key is currently still exposed in the configuration file. You have two options:

**Option A: Remove API Key Completely (Recommended)**

```bash
# Edit packages/snap/src/config.ts and remove the hardcoded key
# The snap will fail gracefully with proper error messages
```

**Option B: Use Environment Variables (For Production)**

```bash
# Set up proper environment variable injection in your build process
export RUGPROOF_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 2. **Clean Up Console Logs** (High Priority)

Run this command to find and remove development console logs:

```bash
# Remove debug utilities (safe to delete)
rm packages/site/src/utils/debug.ts

# Update the main page to remove debug calls
```

### 3. **Update Manifest for Production** (High Priority)

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "source": {
    "location": {
      "npm": {
        "packageName": "@rugproof/metamask-snap",
        "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. **Remove Test Data** (Medium Priority)

- Remove sample addresses from the UI
- Remove development-specific code
- Clean up TODO comments

## üìã **Quick Checklist Before Publishing**

### Security

- [ ] API key removed from source code
- [ ] Input validation added for all user inputs
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Code Quality

- [ ] All console.log statements removed
- [ ] ESLint errors fixed
- [ ] Unused imports removed
- [ ] JSDoc documentation complete

### Testing

- [ ] All security features tested
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Different networks tested

### Publishing

- [ ] Package.json configured for npm publishing
- [ ] Proper package name and description
- [ ] GitHub repository set up
- [ ] README.md created

## üõ†Ô∏è **Commands to Run**

```bash
# 1. Clean up the codebase
yarn lint --fix

# 2. Test everything works
cd packages/snap && yarn build
cd ../site && yarn build

# 3. Test the snap locally
./start-dev.sh

# 4. Run security checks
# (Install snapper and run security scan)
```

## ‚ö° **Quick Production Version**

For a quick production-ready version:

1. **Remove the API key** from config.ts
2. **Delete debug.ts** file
3. **Remove console.log** statements from main files
4. **Update manifest** with production package name
5. **Test everything** still works
6. **Build and publish** to npm

## üéØ **Time Estimate**

- **Critical fixes**: 2-3 hours
- **Full production ready**: 1-2 days
- **Allowlist submission**: 1 week
